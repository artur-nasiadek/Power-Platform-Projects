## Personal Library Manager w/ Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse

<h4>This app helps to keep track of books in user's personal library.
The user can add a book into the app by scanning the book's barcode that contains ISBN. Using Google Books API the app extracts for the given ISBN the book's details:
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>title,</li>
<li>author's name,</li>
<li>book cover image.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
The details are added into Dataverse table that feeds the app.</h4>


After opening the app the welcome screen is displayed with app's name and a buttom that leads to the list of books.
